## Problem Statement
Given an array representing n positions along a straight line. Find k (where k <= n) elements from the array such that the minimum distance between any two (consecutive points among the k points) is maximized.

---
## How to use code
Firstly Clone the project into the local machine using command:
```
#Download project
 git clone https://github.com/SlokAks/DAA.git

```
Go to the to the project directory:
```
cd DAA/Assignemt
```
Run the code
```
g++ FinalCode -o FinalCode.c
./a.out

```
Input
```

Output
```
arr : -64449 38662 68548 52923 -24042 -27017 97376 34382 -70521
The maximised minimum distance is : 62994
The K(= 3) - elements in which minimum distance between any two consecutive points is maximised are :
